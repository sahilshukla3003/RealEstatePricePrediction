## Features

- Real-time real estate price prediction based on user-provided property details.
- Basic web interface for user interaction.
- Integration with a pre-trained machine learning model.
- Clean and user-friendly design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask (install with `pip install Flask`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sahilshukla3003/RealEstatePricePrediction.git
   cd RealEstatePricePrediction
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Start the Flask application:

```shell
python app.py
```

Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to access the web application.

Fill out the property details form, and click the "Predict" button to get a real estate price estimate.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Flask application.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the web interface.
- `static/`: Static files such as CSS and JavaScript.
- `model/`: Contains the pre-trained machine learning model.

## Machine Learning Model

The real estate price prediction model is trained on a dataset of real estate properties and used to make predictions.

## Web Application

The web application is built with Flask, a Python web framework. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input property details and receive price predictions.

## Deployment

You can deploy this application to a production environment using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure. Be sure to set up a production-ready web server like Gunicorn for serving the Flask app.
